# How to run wasm in nextjs?

In this article, we will create a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that runs Web assembly (WASM) in a react client component.

If you don't know what WASM is, I will not explain it here. You can check out the MDN article [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Guides/Concepts)

## Setting up the environment

First, we need to create our starter app. We will use [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) and [bun](https://bun.sh/) to create a new next.js app.

```bash
bunx create-next-app
```

```bash
What is your project named? next-wasm
Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No
```

After installation, you can run your app with the `bun run dev` command and hope everything is working fine.

To work with our code, we can delete unnecessary starter codes from the home page and keep only the basic code.

```typescript
import Image from "next/image"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 flex w-full h-full items-center gap-[10rem] justify-center flex-col font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]">
      <div className="flex flex-row gap-[2rem] items-center justify-center">
        <Image
          className="dark:invert"
          src="/next.svg"
          alt="Next.js logo"
          width={180}
          height={38}
          priority
        />

        {/* Optionally, you can download wasm.svg to the public folder or delete it here */}
        <div className='text-[4rem]'>/</div>
        <Image
          src="/wasm.svg"
          alt="WASM logo"
          width={90}
          height={90}
          priority
        />
      </div>
      <main className='text-white text-2xl font-[500]'>
        {/*TODO*/}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can download wasm.svg from Wikipedia [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/WebAssembly_Logo.svg) and paste it in the `public` directory of our project.

## Creating a C file

Create a new file named `hello.c` in the `src/c` directory of our project. Then paste the following code into it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <emscripten/emscripten.h>
#define EXTERN

EXTERN EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE void myFunction(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello world\n");
}
```

The only thing the `myFunction` function does is print "Hello World" on the console. [EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE Tells the compiler and linker to preserve a symbol, and export it, as if you added it to EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE). We will define EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS in the next step.

## Compiling wasm file

To compile our C code to WASM, we need to use emscripten. If you don't have it installed, you can install it [here](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

After installation, we can compile our C code to WASM by using my custom bash script. Paste it in `src/bash/gen_hello_wasm.bash` file. Make sure to modify the script according to your preferences and your operating system. I'm using linux, so if you are using windows, you can change the script accordingly.

```bash
script_dir="$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")"
echo $script_dir
cd $script_dir

file_name="hello"
out_files_path="../../public"
in_files_path="../c"


echo "Setting up emsdk environment..."

# Make sure change here to your emsdk path
source /home/notfound404/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

echo "Compiling code..."
emcc -o $out_files_path/$file_name.js $in_files_path/$file_name.c -O3 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_myFunction']" -s "EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall']"

# If you are not using linux, you can change here. This command replaces "Module" texts to file_name in js file
sed -i "s/Module/$file_name/g" $out_files_path/$file_name.js
```

All the bash script does is:

1. Setting up emsdk environment
2. Compiling C code to wasm and generate js, wasm files with following parameters:

   - `-o $out_files_path/$file_name.js $in_files_path/$file_name.c` : Specifies file names and paths for the output files (hello.wasm, hello.js) and input file (hello.c)
   - `-O3` : Optimization level - **THIS IS IMPORTANT** If you don't use optimization flag, output javascript file will be very large (maybe 50kb+) and will take a long time to load.
   - `-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_myFunction']"` : Exported function names
   - `-s "EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall']"` : Exported runtime methods

   For more information about these parameters, you can check [emscripten documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html)

3. Renaming the default "Module" name to the file name to make sure that the name is unique if you have multiple wasm files.

After running the script, we will get a `hello.js` and `hello.wasm` files in `public` directory of our project. You maybe asking why we generated JS file? Answer is simply, generated javascript file will allow us to access the WASM file content.

## Running wasm

In our home page, we can load our wasm file using next.js Script component from "next/script" package.

```tsx
<main className="text-2xl font-[500] text-white">
  <Script src="/hello.js" />
</main>
```

`Hello.js` file will setup wasm enviroment and load the wasm file content in the window object. Then we can access it by using `window.hello` object.

Let's create nice nice-looking button to run our wasm code. Paste the following code in `src/app/DisplayMsgBtn.tsx`.

```tsx
'use client';

export const DisplayMsgBtn = () => {
  const handleOnClick = () => {
    if (!window.hello) return;

    window.hello.ccall('myFunction', null, null, null);
    alert('Check console for output');
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={handleOnClick}
      className="disabled:opacity-45 cursor-pointer rounded-md bg-white px-3 py-1 text-2xl font-[500] text-black duration-300"
    >
      Display Message
    </button>
  );
};
```

If you are using Typescript, you might see `Property 'hello' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'` error. This is because we are using `window` object in typescript. To fix this, we can create a new file named `window.d.ts` in the `src/types` directory of our project and paste the following code in it. If you want to know more about that, you can check this article [here](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-properly-type-window)

```
export { }

declare global {
    interface Window {
        hello: any;
    }
}
```

Add `DisplayMsgBtn` component in our home main section.

```tsx
<main className="text-2xl font-[500] text-white">
  <Script src="/hello.js" />
  <DisplayMsgBtn />
</main>
```

And that's it! You can see the output in the browser console.
