I'm a 18 yo self-taught full-stack web and native android developer from Turkey. I'm having fun building problem solving, performant and secure applications. I have been working myself on my projects as a software engineer for over 3 years now. I have so many hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games. I can speak English and Turkish fluently.

## Why am I self-taught?

I've always been fascinated by technology, science and programming. But when I go to school in turkey, teachers are not very good teaching and students are not eager to learn. Because software ecosystem is changing too fast and schools are not keep up with latest trends and technologies.
