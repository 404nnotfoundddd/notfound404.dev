I'm a 18 yo self-taught full-stack web and native android developer from Turkey. I'm having fun building problem solving, performant and secure applications. I have been working myself on my projects as a software engineer for over 3 years now. I have so many hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games. I can speak English and Turkish fluently.

## Why am I self-taught?

I think turkey's current education system is not good enough to provide a good education for a software developer.
