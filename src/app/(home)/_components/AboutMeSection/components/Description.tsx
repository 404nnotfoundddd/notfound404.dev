                Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my articles, contents etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an 18 yo person who chose programming as my career. I work 90 hours per week myself to learn computer science, trying to learn everything I can to create new projects, from web development to machine learning. Because I love computers, I enjoy seeing how powerful binary can be. I have many other hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games.

                Also, I'm not going to school and have no certificate because everyone who can think logically can understand that Turkey's education system is so bad and getting worse. As a citizen of Turkey, I can say school is just a waste of time.            </p>
